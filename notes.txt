Project 4: Avoid bad passwords like “monkey” (an actual top-ten password!)
“John the Ripper” password crackers run thousands of dictionary words and common combinations against a login page,
finding the one that works -- unless the password was created by a pro.
How can players experience “John the Ripper” firsthand in a safe, game environment?

Our goal in this hackathon is to develop new, fun, straightforward games that teach other cybersecurity best practices.
In 24 hours, team will choose a project from the menu of options, come up with a basic game concept,
and implement a simple prototype that puts the user “in the driver’s seat”
and makes abstract cybersecurity principles real in a visceral way.
Outputs will be judged based on creativity, usability, polish, and likelihood of actually changing the habits of the player.

Keep in mind the characteristics of a strong password:
a long password that consists of both letters and numbers
and is used only for your Google Account and not for other sites and services.

"Once an exhaustive password search begins, the most important factor is password length!"
The important thing to take away from this comic is that longer passwords are better
because each additional character adds much more time to the breaking of the password.
Complexity does not matter unless you have length in passwords.
Complexity is more difficult for humans to remember, but length is not.

Difficulty to guess
Difficulty to remember
Or, in other words:

The computer aspect
The human aspect
All too often, when discussing complex passwords, strong policies, expiration, etc
we tend to focus overly much on the computer aspects, and skip over the human aspects.

===

Easy to Guess is bad, but Hard to Remember is equally so
And that principle is a correct one. We should remember this more often:
Security at the expense of usability, comes at the expense of security

project ideas
	create game with tree visualization

Give the game some login you have and see how long John the Ripper takes to tear it apart

Take a mock FB profile or something, then have the player try to guess the password from this information.
